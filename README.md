# learning-react
This is the repository where I will keep the code I am writing while I am learning React! I am completing the "React For Beginners" course on Wes Bos.  
  
## Motivation
I've been learning and using AngularJS recently as part of my apprenticeship, and we're also learning React. I'm very much enjoying learning React given that AngularJS is getting obsolete, and I personally find React a lot easier to work with too! I have enjoyed learning about these frameworks to extend what I can do with my web applications and make them easier to work with.

## Tech/Framework Used
I think this is a little self-explanatory ðŸ˜‚. This repository is of course using React, as well as a little bit of vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS and Stylus. Wes Bos' tutorial focuses on doing the React side of things, so I did not write any of the CSS or the helper functions in this.

## Installation
Firstly, you may want to clone Wes Bos' repo instead of mine: https://github.com/wesbos/React-For-Beginners-Starter-Files  
  
But if you REALLY want to install this repo, feel free to:
- Do the good old `git clone https://github.com/cBridges851/learning-react.git`
- `npm install` to install the NPM packages

## Usage
- `npm start` to start the React application, and you should be given a local address and a network IP address to access the site from.
- I'll post more on how to use the site when I have completed all the tutorials ðŸ˜Š
